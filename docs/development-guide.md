> Last updated: SCRUM-23 — Captain MP OAuth flow to connect Mercado Pago account

## Project Overview
App that reads data from an external REST API and visualizes it in a different way.

- **Jira**: https://petreles.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1
- **Stack**: Next.js 14 (App Router, backend/API), Angular 18 (frontend), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest + Angular TestBed, Cypress (E2E)

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.19.0+
- npm 10+
- Docker (for PostgreSQL)

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone [repo-url]
cd data-viewer
npm run setup       # Install backend + frontend dependencies
npm run dev         # Start Docker, backend (3000), and frontend (4200)
```

That's it. `npm run dev` handles everything:
1. Starts PostgreSQL via Docker (port 5433, with healthcheck)
2. Creates `backend/.env.local` from `.env.example` if missing
3. Starts backend (Next.js, port 3000) and frontend (Angular, port 4200) concurrently

### Available Scripts (root)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run setup` | Install dependencies for backend and frontend |
| `npm run dev` | Start Docker + backend + frontend (single command) |
| `npm run db:down` | Stop the Docker PostgreSQL container |
| `npm test` | Run all backend and frontend tests |

### Environment Variables
```env
# backend/.env.local (auto-created from .env.example on first npm run dev)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://cec:cec123@localhost:5433/data_viewer
JWT_SECRET=dev-secret-change-in-production
WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com    # Base URL for MP webhook notifications (omit in dev to skip)
MP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-mp-webhook-secret    # Mercado Pago webhook signing secret (omit to skip signature validation)
MP_CLIENT_ID=your-mp-app-client-id          # Mercado Pago app client ID (required for captain OAuth flow)
MP_CLIENT_SECRET=your-mp-app-client-secret  # Mercado Pago app client secret (required for captain OAuth flow)
MP_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/api/mp/callback  # Must be a public HTTPS URL (use ngrok); MP rejects localhost
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:4200              # Where the backend redirects after OAuth callback
```

Frontend API base URL is configured in `frontend/src/environments/environment.ts`.

### Run Tests
```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Backend only — with coverage
cd backend && npx jest --coverage

# Frontend only — with coverage
cd frontend && npx jest --coverage

# E2E (requires npm run dev running)
cd frontend && npx cypress run
```

### Data Flow
```
External API → backend/lib/services/ → backend/app/api/ → Angular Service → Component → UI
```

All external data fetching is isolated in `backend/src/lib/services/`. API routes expose typed endpoints. Angular services call the API via `HttpClient`. Components handle loading, error, and empty states.

## Known Decisions & Trade-offs
> Architecture decisions are added here as they are made.

- Separate backend (Next.js 14, port 3000) and frontend (Angular 18, port 4200) projects
- All external API calls isolated in `backend/src/lib/services/` to decouple UI from data source
- Player data hardcoded initially in the service layer — typed interfaces ready for API swap
- Player/Category types duplicated between backend and frontend (shared package planned for later)
- CORS headers configured in `backend/next.config.mjs` for dev (allows `http://localhost:4200`)
- Category change does not trigger a loading spinner — content stays visible during player fetch (SCRUM-7)
- Fixture page uses `forkJoin` to load matches and clubs in parallel — if either fails, the whole page shows an error (SCRUM-8)
- External Hockey Chubut API URLs hardcoded in `fixtureService.ts` — matches current tournament/fixture IDs (SCRUM-8)
- Date-only detection for pending matches uses `T03:00:00Z` heuristic (midnight Argentina time) — revisit if API changes (SCRUM-8)
- Dashboard uses Chart.js directly (not ng2-charts wrapper) — ng2-charts `BaseChartDirective` caused Angular rendering issues where sibling cards failed to render; manual `AfterViewChecked` initialization avoids this (SCRUM-9)
- Dashboard `forkJoin` for player data: if any single category's player fetch fails, the entire dashboard shows an error (all-or-nothing) — matches fixture page pattern (SCRUM-9)
- Default route changed from `/players` to `/dashboard` (SCRUM-9)
- Navigation menu lives in `AppComponent` (wraps `<router-outlet>`) — not a separate component, since it's the only persistent UI shell (SCRUM-10)
- CEC logo served from `frontend/public/logo-cec.png` — Angular 18 `public/` directory serves files at root (SCRUM-10)
- Mobile menu toggle uses Angular `signal()` for local state — no service needed for simple UI toggle (SCRUM-10)
- PostgreSQL chosen over SQLite for auth database — user preference for production-ready storage (SCRUM-11)
- JWT tokens signed with `jsonwebtoken`, 8h expiry, payload contains `{ userId, role }` — no refresh tokens (SCRUM-11)
- Passwords hashed with `bcrypt` (10 salt rounds) — never stored or transmitted in plaintext (SCRUM-11)
- Database connection via `pg` Pool singleton in `backend/src/lib/db.ts` — schema auto-created via `initDatabase()` (SCRUM-11)
- Default admin seeded on first run (`admin@cec.com` / `admin123`) when users table is empty (SCRUM-11)
- Auth guard (`CanActivateFn`) protects all routes except `/login` — checks token in localStorage, validates via `GET /api/auth/me` (SCRUM-11)
- HTTP interceptor attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to all API requests; on 401 (except login), clears token and redirects to `/login` (SCRUM-11)
- Nav bar hidden on `/login` page via `isLoginPage()` check in `AppComponent` — login has its own centered layout (SCRUM-11)
- CORS config updated to allow `POST, PUT, DELETE` methods and `Authorization` header for auth requests (SCRUM-11)
- Cypress `loginAsAdmin()` custom command added to `cypress/support/e2e.ts` — sets mock token + intercepts `/auth/me` for all existing E2E tests (SCRUM-11)
- Auth middleware in `backend/src/lib/middleware/auth.ts` provides `extractAuth` → `requireAuth` → `requireRole` — layered pattern returns either `AuthPayload` or `NextResponse` (instanceof check in route handlers) (SCRUM-12)
- Admin guard (`adminGuard`) is self-contained: checks token, loads user if needed, verifies `role === 'admin'`, redirects non-admins to `/dashboard` (SCRUM-12)
- Dashboard and Players pages filter categories by `user.categoryId` for player role — admin sees all, player sees only their assigned category (SCRUM-12)
- Admin nav link conditionally rendered via `authService.user()?.role === 'admin'` in `app.component.html` for both desktop and mobile (SCRUM-12)
- Cypress `loginAsPlayer()` custom command added for role-based E2E tests — sets mock player token with configurable categoryId (SCRUM-12)
- Docker PostgreSQL mapped to host port 5433 (not 5432) via `POSTGRES_PORT` env var to avoid conflicts with local PostgreSQL installations (SCRUM-13)
- `npm run dev` uses npm `predev` hook to auto-start Docker and create `.env.local` before launching `concurrently` with backend + frontend (SCRUM-13)
- `docker-compose.yml` includes `healthcheck` with `pg_isready` — `docker compose up -d --wait` blocks until PostgreSQL is accepting connections (SCRUM-13)
- Categories updated from 3 placeholders (Mixto Sub 14 A/B, Mixto Sub 16) to 6 real club divisions: Sub 14, Sub 16, Sub 19, Primera, Intermedia, Caballeros — hardcoded in `playerService.ts`, IDs unchanged (cat-1 through cat-6) (SCRUM-14)
- `UserRole` extended from `'admin' | 'player'` to `'admin' | 'player' | 'captain'` — captain is a player who can also see payment status and mark players as paid for their category (SCRUM-15)
- Fee model uses weekly periods keyed by Monday date — `category_fees` table has UNIQUE(category_id, week_start_date) for UPSERT support (SCRUM-15)
- Per-player amount auto-calculated server-side: `Math.round((totalAmount / availablePlayers) * 100) / 100` — frontend shows a preview but backend is the source of truth (SCRUM-15)
- `resetWeeklyFees()` function in `feeService.ts` copies last week's fee configs and creates new `player_fees` rows with 'pending' status — scheduling mechanism (cron/external trigger) to be wired separately (SCRUM-15)
- Auth middleware extended with `requireAnyRole(request, roles[])` — used by `mark-paid` endpoint to allow both admin and captain access (SCRUM-15)
- `captain_mp_config` table created in schema for future Mercado Pago token storage (one per category) — not populated until SCRUM-16 (SCRUM-15)
- Admin nav now shows two links ("Users" and "Fees") instead of one — both gated by `role === 'admin'` in template and `adminGuard` on routes (SCRUM-15)
- Cypress `loginAsCaptain()` custom command added for captain role E2E tests (SCRUM-15)
- Mercado Pago integration uses `mercadopago` npm SDK v3 — `MercadoPagoConfig`, `Preference`, `Payment`, `WebhookSignatureValidator` classes (SCRUM-16)
- Payment preferences route through captain's MP access token (from `captain_mp_config` table) — each category's payments go to that category's captain's MP account (SCRUM-16)
- `playerFeeId` is embedded as a query parameter in the MP `notification_url` — webhook extracts it to identify which player fee to mark as paid (SCRUM-16)
- Webhook validates `payment.external_reference === playerFeeId` after fetching payment status from MP API — prevents cross-payment fraud where an attacker replays a valid payment notification against a different fee (SCRUM-16)
- Webhook signature validation is optional (active when `MP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var is set) — allows local development without MP webhook signing, production must set the secret (SCRUM-16)
- `binary_mode: true` on MP preferences — forces approved/rejected only (no in_process or pending states), simplifying webhook handling (SCRUM-16)
- Player fees page (`/fees`) lazy-loaded via Angular route — shows Pay button (pending) or Paid badge (paid) based on player's fee status (SCRUM-16)
- Fees page renders role-based views: captain sees full player list with red/green badges and paid/unpaid counts; player sees own fee with Pay/Paid state (SCRUM-17)
- Player warning banner uses fixture match dates with 4-day threshold — `forkJoin` with `catchError` on fixture API so fees page degrades gracefully if fixture service is down (SCRUM-17)
- Admin dashboard loads fee data (`GET /api/fees`) and renders paid/unpaid donut charts per category using the same Chart.js pattern as active/inactive player charts — only loaded for admin role (SCRUM-17)
- Captain payment status visibility is on-refresh (no WebSocket/polling) — captain sees updated statuses each time they load the fees page (SCRUM-17)
- Player data now DB-backed — `playerService` queries PostgreSQL `users` and `categories` tables instead of hardcoded arrays; all functions are async (SCRUM-21)
- `categories` table seeded on `initDatabase()` with 6 rows (Sub 14, Sub 16, Sub 19, Primera, Intermedia, Caballeros) using `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for idempotency (SCRUM-21)
- `player_number` column added to `users` table via idempotent `DO $ ... IF NOT EXISTS ... END $` migration block — nullable integer for jersey number (SCRUM-21)
- Captain swap uses PostgreSQL transaction (`BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK` via `getClient()`) — demotes old captain and promotes new captain atomically to prevent inconsistent state on failure (SCRUM-21)
- Player `status` hardcoded to `'active'` — monthly fee-based status calculation is TBD (SCRUM-21)
- User update (`PUT /api/users/:id`) password field is optional — only hashes and updates if provided, otherwise keeps current hash (SCRUM-22)
- User delete is hard delete — cascades `player_fees` rows first, catches FK constraint violations from `category_fees.created_by` and returns 409 instead of 500 (SCRUM-22)
- Admin cannot delete their own account — backend enforces `auth.userId !== params.id` check before proceeding (SCRUM-22)
- Frontend reuses the create-user form for editing — `editingUser()` signal toggles between create/edit mode, form title, and submit behavior (SCRUM-22)
- Captain MP OAuth uses Mercado Pago's authorization code flow — captain clicks "Connect", gets redirected to MP login, authorizes, and app stores the access token in `captain_mp_config` (SCRUM-23)
- MP OAuth requires `MP_CLIENT_ID`, `MP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MP_REDIRECT_URI`, and `FRONTEND_URL` env vars — app must be registered with MP as an integration (one-time developer setup) (SCRUM-23)
- `MP_REDIRECT_URI` must point to the backend `/api/mp/callback` via a public HTTPS URL (ngrok in dev) — MP rejects localhost URLs (SCRUM-23)
- OAuth callback (`/api/mp/callback`) has no JWT auth — uses `state` query param (captain userId) to identify the user, then 307 redirects to `FRONTEND_URL/fees?mp=success|error` (SCRUM-23)
- Frontend `/fees` page reads `?mp=success` or `?mp=error&message=...` query params and displays a flash banner (SCRUM-23)
- `POST /api/fees/pay` now returns 404 (not 500) when `captain_mp_config` is missing — friendly "Payments not yet configured for this category" message (SCRUM-23)
